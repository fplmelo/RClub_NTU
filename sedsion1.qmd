## Data preparation

Here I am using data from Rbase to demnstrate the power of an active script
```{r echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
data("mtcars") # This is cars dataser=t
mtcars
```

## Knowing the data

```{r summary}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Summarizing by graphs

Checking distribution of horsepower HP

```{r Histogram}
hist(mtcars$hp)
```
